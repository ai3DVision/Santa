This code is written in MATLAB, extracted from a large system we implemented. It consists of FNN and CNN. To run the CNN, you further need:

* MatConvNet (http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/). We use version: matconvnet-1.0-beta12

This code runs on CPU, but the GPU implementation is also provided in the code.

## How to use the code

Run the FNN experiments: 
-- simply run the scripts: test_FNN_400.m and test_FNN_800.m

Run the CNN experiments: 
-- first install MatConvNet
-- then set the path in environmentVariables.m
-- run test_cnn.m

These will give similar results reported in the paper.
