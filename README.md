# Santa
Code for the Santa algorithm for deep learning

The Code incldues a MATLAB version for the FNN and CNN, a Python version for the RNN, and an implementation in Caffe for large-scale learning. The algorithm is proposed in the AISTATS 2016 paper "Bridging the Gap between Stochastic Gradient MCMC and Stochastic Optimization".
